# San_Francisco_housing

## Overview

In this project, I will explore the San Francisco housing market using hvplot to find out if properties in the San Francisco market are viable investment opportunities.

## Results

### Did any year experience a drop in the average sale price per square foot compared to the previous year?
Yes, from 2010-2011

### Did the gross rent increase or decrease during that year?
No

### Which neighborhood has the highest gross rent, and which has the highest sale price per square foot?
Westwood Park has the highest gross rent, and Union Square District has the highest sale price per square foot.

### How does the trend in rental income growth compare to the trend in ? Does this same trend hold true for all the neighborhoods across San Francisco?
Rental income growth is trending up overtime while sales prices say mostly the same. This is true for for all the neighborhoods across San Francisco.

## Summary

### Do neighborhoods exist that you would suggest for investment, and why?
If we offer clients investment opportunities in the San Francisco housing market, our clients' income from rent is expected to increase over time, but sale price will not appreciate by much. The potential for profit exists, but more data is needed to see if the opportunity cost is worth it, for example compaired to investing in an index fund.
